/** Handle allowing to store and retrieve some value inside [[MIO]] computations.
  *
  * It differs from using a global var in that:
  *   - separate runs of the same [[MIO]] program would have separate lifecycles of the local value (each would
  *     initialize it, then modify its own copy of the value)
  *   - when combining [[MIO]] programs sequentially, the value would be passed under the hood without us having to
  *     carry it around
  *   - when using the "parallel" semantics ([[MIO.parMap2]], [[MIO.parTuple]]), we are able to modify value for each
  *     "fiber", and provide a reasonable way of combining values from 2 different "fibers" back into a single value
