# Hearth

The first Scala macros' standard library.

Planned features:

 - being able to build the code with `Type`s, `Expr`s and high-level utilities that operate on them - limitting the need for AST and Symbols manipulation
 - cross-compilable API, allowing reuse of the macro code for both Scala 2 and Scala 3
 - exhaustive documentation lowering the barrier of entry
 - no dependencies on additional ecosystems (some FP-utilities would be already provided)

## Work in Progress

Hearth is an evolution of [chimney-macro-commons](https://github.com/scalalandio/chimney-macro-commons/) idea,
but one that could serve not only [Chimney](https://chimney.readthedocs.io/) but also any library that uses macros.

While some utilities could be easily migrated, some requres a lot of new effort to make them more generic.
What you see here should be treated as an early alpha.

If you want to help get this library out of the door then, first, thank you!, and second, please see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).
