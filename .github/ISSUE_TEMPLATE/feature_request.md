As long as the library is on its Proof-of-Concept stage - that is until [these tasks are done](https://github.com/MateuszKubuszok/hearth/issues/36) -
thers is no point in creating bug reports (we already know that these are not yet reliable) or creating new feature requests.

For the time being we suggest to discuss:

 - in the existing issues (when asking about them),
 - in pull requests (when when discussion is about addressing the issue)
 - creating a [new discussion](https://github.com/MateuszKubuszok/hearth/discussions), when it's none of the above

Once the library is released as 0.1.0, with _some_ features provided, we would start using bugs and feature requests.

**Describe the desired behavior**

A clear and concise description of what would the feature provide.

**Use case example**

A snippet of code with an example how this feature could be used and for what.

**How it relates to existing features**

Would it be possible to achieve the same functionality with existing features? Does it change the existing behavior (breaking change) or adds a new one?

**Additional context**

Add any other context about the problem here.
